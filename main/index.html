            <p class=thetxt>Bhaya Siddu happy birthday. If you would have been in hostel, then by today morning you
                would be catching your bums
                because we would be giving you birthday bums and would have covered your face with cake. But since</p>

            <p class=thetxt> Hey Siddu! What a ride it has been.Stuck beside each other since the first sem. You walking
                out while a test or class is going on
                still cracks me up. I bunked my first class with you guys, all the projects and assignments together,
                the parties, basketball games, sliders and shakers, the Namah Shivaya incident XD, and so many memories
                i can't fit it in this paragraph. So of
                course im going to do what any friend will, Mention only the most embarassing incidents. First the most
                important one!!
                Rowdy!!!!!!!!, You know this is going to stick with you throught the four years and who knows something
                might happen between you both,
                So i'll save further embarassment for that time. Remember the other Ronaldo and Messi at the foreign
                canteen(Inside secret).
                Our uncultural meetings and your game of thrones and High School DXD addictions :P. Well I have no
                intention of making this cheesy,
                I know I can be a handful, but thanks for sticking by me. Future Elon Musk!!!!!!!</p>

            <p class=thetxt> Hey man, Happy Birthday. From a roomie to the only best friend with whom I can share
                anything in the whole college we had a very good time. We enjoyed a lot, chilled in free time, completed
                our works with good music on. Initially I never used to care about what is going in the room, but now I
                really miss watching movies with you and playing COD with rathinn, srikar and you. I miss those
                pointless conversations we had. Once again Happy birthday Sid, I wish for your great future.</p>
